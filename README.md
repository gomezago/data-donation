# Sensitive Data Donation
This repo contains the code of a working prototype of a digital-trace data donation platform. The platform is developed using the Python-based web framework Django. Through the platform, potential data donors can upload different types of files (e.g., a Zip folder, a JSON file) containing their digital-trace data (e.g., Google Assistant logs), obtained from product and service providers (e.g., Google Takeout). 

The platform has been developed for specific research projects. It currently supports files from the following product and service providers: Clue App, Google Assistant, Garmin, and Apple Health.

## Code
The platform is developed using the Python-based web framework Django. It is built upon the open-source tools of the Data-Centric Design Lab. Particularly Bucket [https://dwd.tudelft.nl/bucket/](https://dwd.tudelft.nl/bucket/), a cloud application that facilitates the ingestion and distribution of data from various languages and platforms. These tools are hosted in Delft, The Netherlands by the Technical University of Delft (TU Delft).

## Research
The platform has been used for collecting digital-trace data for the following publications:
