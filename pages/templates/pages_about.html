      <p>
          This platform is part of the <a href="https://datacentricdesign.org/">Data-Centric Design Lab</a> and its initiative to develop the appropriate means and mechanisms so that designers can access, manipulate, and understand machine data.
          We see data donation as an opportunity to actively participate in design and research projects through personal (machine) data.<br>
          We define data donation as a transaction of personal data from one person (data donor) to another person or entity (data recipients) to be reused for a project in design and research contexts.
