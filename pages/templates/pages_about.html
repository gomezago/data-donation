        <h1>What is Data Donation?</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered how you can contribute to design and research projects that interest you?
            Well, you can do it through data donation.
            By becoming a data donor, you give your data (e.g., pictures, audio recordings, sensor data, location logs)
            to designers and researchers working on data-centric design projects ranging from designing a new product or service to understanding the habits of people like you.
            But that is not all, you can also opt for greater involvement in these projects by participating in later stages and receiving updates.
        </p>
        <h1>How can I become a data donor?</h1>
        <p>
            To become a data donor you can choose a project that interests you, to which you want to collaborate, and submit your data.
            You can choose to donate the same data to one or more projects.
            Your data will be of great help for these projects, but you can help even more by giving more information about you and your context,
            that will result in more detailed insights, and agreeing to participate in additional activities such as workshops, co-creation sessions and interviews.
            You can also choose to follow along the development of the project and receive information about the projectâ€™s outputs.

        </p>
        <h1>What happens to the data I donate?</h1>
        <p>
            The data you donate will be used to drive a design or research project.
            It will be used by designers or researchers who are committed to keeping you up to date on how it is being used and what they are learning from it (if you are interested).
            Besides, the data will be stored in TU Delft servers for the entire duration of the project(s) and it might be used for scientific publications (with your permission).
        </p>
        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>This project is built and maintained by a group of people within the <a href="https://datacentricdesign.org/">Data-Centric Design Lab</a>.
            We are part of the Knowledge and Intelligence Design (KInD) section within the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering.<br>
            We see data donation as a way of supporting responsible data collection practices for data-centric design projects.
            If you want to collaborate with us, or you have a project that could gain value from data donation do not hesitate to contact us.
